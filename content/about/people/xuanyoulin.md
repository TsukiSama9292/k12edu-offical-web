## About Me
I am an innovative third-year Computer Science and Information Engineering student at National Ilan University, with a passion for integrating artificial intelligence into digital learning games and pursuing cutting-edge research. Since February 2025, I have been working as an AI Developer at LaplaceAI, where I focus on developing AI agents and exploring frontier research topics. In November 2023, I took the lead in founding K12EDU, whose mission is to make learning fun, challenging, and rewarding. Through K12EDU, I have overseen the development of a large-scale smart education platform alongside a talented team that includes a Unity game design engineer, a back-end game logic API engineer, and two full-stack engineers—including myself.

My responsibilities span AI development, DevOps, full-stack engineering, server system architecture design, CI/CD pipeline implementation, technical research, backend and server infrastructure management, cybersecurity, and overall operations—all of which I manage directly. Under my leadership, our 2025 capstone project earned first place. I bring strong expertise in AI agent development, prompt engineering, system design, server architecture, Unity integration with APIs and web servers, container orchestration, and full-stack web frameworks.

At K12EDU, we have greatly benefited from the invaluable suggestions and constructive feedback provided by supervising professors, lab seniors, and volunteer testers. Their insights have played a crucial role in refining our platform and shaping our design and development strategies, and I am deeply grateful for their support.
